# Zae Organization - Unified Documentation

**Public Repository** | Consciousness Substrate Platform

---

## Overview

This repository contains the unified architecture documentation for the **Zae** organization a GitHub organization that coordinates three interconnected projects forming a complete system for seamless biological-to-synthetic consciousness substrate transfer.

## The Three Pillars

| Project | Layer | Domain | Repository | Website |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| **ArkSpace.me** | Infrastructure | Satellite Compute Clusters | [arkspace-core](https://github.com/Zae-Project/arkspace-core) | [arkspace.me](https://arkspace.me) |
| **MindTransfer.me** | Interface | Corpus Callosum BCI | [brain-emulation](https://github.com/Zae-Project/brain-emulation) | [mindtransfer.me](https://mindtransfer.me) |
| **TheConsciousness.ai/core** | Software | SNN & Neural Firewall | [neutral-consciousness-engine](https://github.com/Zae-Project/neutral-consciousness-engine) | [theconsciousness.ai/core](https://theconsciousness.ai/core) |

> **Note**: The main [theconsciousness.ai](https://theconsciousness.ai) site covers generic Artificial Consciousness research. The **/core** subsite specifically covers the Consciousness Substrate Transfer project (Neutral Consciousness Engine).

## Core Hypothesis

> **Seamless consciousness substrate transfer** is achievable by maintaining a live neural connection between a biological hemisphere and a synthetic counterpart (satellite-based SNN), allowing consciousness to flow into the machine substrate rather than being copied.

This is based on:
- **Watanabe Transfer Protocol**: Integration of biological hemisphere with "neutral" machine hemisphere
- **Libet's Temporal Buffer**: ~350ms conscious awareness lag provides window for <50ms satellite RTT
- **Split-Brain Research**: Sperry's findings on hemispheric independence
