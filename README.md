# Zae Organization - Unified Documentation

**Private Repository** | Consciousness Substrate Platform

---

## Overview

This repository contains the unified architecture documentation for the **Zae** organization - a private GitHub organization that coordinates three interconnected projects forming a complete system for seamless biological-to-synthetic consciousness substrate transfer.

## The Three Pillars

| Project | Layer | Domain | Public Repo | Website |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **ArkSpace.me** | Infrastructure | Satellite Compute Clusters | [arkspace-me](https://github.com/arkspace-me) | [arkspace.me](https://arkspace.me) |
| **MindTransfer.me** | Interface | Corpus Callosum BCI | [brain_emulation](https://github.com/venturaEffect/brain_emulation) | [mindtransfer.me](https://mindtransfer.me) |
| **TheConsciousness.ai/core** | Software | SNN & Neural Firewall | [neutral-consciousness-engine](https://github.com/venturaEffect/neutral-consciousness-engine) | [theconsiousness.ai/core](https://theconsiousness.ai/core) |

> **Note**: The main [theconsiousness.ai](https://theconsiousness.ai) site covers generic Artificial Consciousness research. The **/core** subsite specifically covers the Consciousness Substrate Transfer project (Neutral Consciousness Engine).

## Core Hypothesis

> **Seamless consciousness substrate transfer** is achievable by maintaining a live neural connection between a biological hemisphere and a synthetic counterpart (satellite-based SNN), allowing consciousness to flow into the machine substrate rather than being copied.

This is based on:
- **Watanabe Transfer Protocol**: Integration of biological hemisphere with "neutral" machine hemisphere
- **Libet's Temporal Buffer**: ~350ms conscious awareness lag provides window for <50ms satellite RTT
- **Split-Brain Research**: Sperry's findings on hemispheric independence
